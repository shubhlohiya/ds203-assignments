    "Datatypes in python like `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str` exist to serve as the best way to represent and efficiently store data of various types. Different forms of data have different memory and functional requirements, hence efficient handling of such data requires us to have different tailored object classes or containers to store this information. These specialized classes/containers form the python datatypes. For eg, floating point data like decimal numbers are stored as `float` objects in python whereas strings which can be of arbitrary length (forming words, sentences, articles, or even entire books) are stored in specialized `str` objects that are optimized for the same.  \n",
    "Since different types of operations are valid on different kinds of data, having datatypes supporting these specialized operations is very beneficial and efficient. For eg, we might want to perform additions or subtractions of floating numbers, whereas in case of strings we have different operations like concatenation and capitalization. In python, datatypes are equipped with support for such common operations on the data they contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, statistical data types are defined to segregate the different kinds of data seen in the real world. This data is largely either categorical or numerical. But to have a more finer distinction between different kinds of data and the operations they support, we have the following scales of data: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio (the latter two being numerical in nature). Numerical datatypes are also classified as either continuous or quantized. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in conclusion, the type of data seen is categorized among the statistical data types, and when we work with such data on our computer in say python programming, we use the programming data types to store this data and perform operations on them. For eg, floating point data can be categorized as continuous, and either ratio or interval. But when we work with this data in python, they are available to us in the form of `float` objects.\n",
